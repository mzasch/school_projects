## What is all this stuff?
This repository is intended to be used by my students of the TPSIT class. 
It will contain ~~all~~
most of the exercises that will be assigned during the year, plus maybe some
extra ones in order to have a better insigth on a specific topic.

As of today, each directory in the repository is an exercise/topic.

- `DadiATre` is the exercise about three players playing a dice game; it
  involves:
  - Java
  - Threads
  - Synchronization and concurrent access to resources
  - GUI
  - Some hint of Observer Design Pattern
- `KnockKnock` is a simple exercise that presents the "Knock knock" joke. It
  involves:
  - Java
  - Sockets
  - Client-server architecture
  - Threads (in the `MultiServer` package)
